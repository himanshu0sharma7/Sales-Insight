 
Introduction
AtliQ Hardware is a company that supplies hardware peripherals to different clients such as nomad stores, and excel stores. These are all the clients and this is a hardware company which will supply computers other peripheral networking equipment to them and they have a head office in let’s say Delhi, India and they have regional offices in different states of India and The sales are declining for this company and a sales director is having a lot of struggle tracking where the business is failing and the sales director doesn’t have any idea on what is happening at a ground level.


Problem Statement
To unlock Sales Insights that are not visible before to the sales team for decision support & automate them to reduce time spent on data gathering


Solution
I have made two Dashboards named - Revenue Analysis and Profit Analysis for tracking the profit and revenue of the company.
The Insights contains -
•	Revenue by Markets
•	Sales Quantity by Markets
•	Profit Margin by Markets
•	Profit trend by Year
•	Revenue by Year
•	Top 5 Customers by Profit and Revenue
•	Top 5 Products by Profit and Revenue

Visualization
 Microsoft Power BI
 
Recommendations
Based on the dashboard insights, I have made some recommendations that the Sales Marketing team should/can consider -
1.	Consider making a sales strategy for especially Bengaluru since it shows the lowest revenue and negative profit margin and, if possible, Surat and Bhubhaneshwar.
2.	Start their target campaign for Prod047 and Prod061 since they two are the most profitable and most selling products.
3.	Try to give special benefits to Electricalsara Store and Electricalslytical stores as they are their most profitable customers.
4.	Try to increase its sales quantity in Patna, Surat, and Kanpur since they have the lowest sales quantity.
5.	Sales team should make some strategy as the Revenue trend is declining every year.
